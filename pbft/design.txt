Objective: Design a web user interface that allows client to read/write to a distributed database
replicated using consensus protocol PBFT. 

Timeline:

December 15-16: Planning: Read more about PBFT and how it works in details, and familiarize with tools + libraries (rpc + incr_dom)
December 17-19: Setup client-server rpc interface 
December 20-26: Implement server-client logic
December 26-30: Design client user interface using incr_dom
December 31-  : Implement server-side logic + testing
